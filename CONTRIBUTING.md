## Reporting bugs

The golden rule is to **always open _one_ issue for _one_ bug**. If you notice
several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for
each of them.

If you're reporting a new bug, you'll make our life simpler (and the
fix will come sooner) by following these guidelines:

### Search first in the existing database

Issues are often reported several times by various users. It's good practice to
**search first in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ca-joue-ce-soir/legobuilder/issues)
before reporting your issue**.

### Provide a simple explanation

To be best understood by our team, please describe your problem in the simplest and most understandable way
so that someone who has never seen your problem can get an idea quickly.

Now that you've read the guidelines, click the link below to create a
bug report:

- **[Report a bug](https://github.com/ca-joue-ce-soir/legobuilder/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)**

## Proposing features or improvements

If you want to contribute to the development of Lego builder without developing (probably due to lack of
skills) you can open what we call "feature proposals".

- **[Proposing feature](https://github.com/ca-joue-ce-soir/legobuilder/issues/new?template=feature_proposal.yml)**

## Communicating with developers

To communicate with developers (e.g. to discuss a feature you want to implement
or a bug you want to fix), you can open a discussion in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ca-joue-ce-soir/legobuilder/discussions)

Thanks for your interest in contributing!
